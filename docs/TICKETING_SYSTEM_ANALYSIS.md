# QWERTY Internal Management System - Ticketing System Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current ticketing system implementation in the QWERTY Internal Management System. The analysis was conducted to understand the existing functionality, identify gaps, and plan future improvements.

## Project Architecture

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage buckets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper relationships and constraints

### **System Structure**

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Admin Portal  │    │  Client Portal   │    │   Supabase      │
│   (Dashboard)   │    │   (Dashboard)    │    │   (Database)    │

                    └──────────────────┘
```

## Current Ticketing System Implementation

### **Database Schema (Inferred from Code)**

Based on the codebase analysis, the tickets table appears to have the following structure:

```sql
tickets (
  id: uuid (primary key)
  user_id: uuid (foreign key to users.id)
  client_id: uuid (foreign key to clients.id)
  title: text
  description: text
  page: text
  file_url: text (nullable)
  status: text (pending, approved, declined)
  created_at: timestamp
)
```

**Note**: This schema is inferred from the TypeScript interfaces and database queries. The actual database schema may have additional fields or constraints.

### **Related Tables**

- `users` - User profiles with roles (admin/client)
- `clients` - Client-specific information
- `auth.users` - Supabase Auth users (managed by Supabase)

### **File Storage**

- **Bucket**: `ticket-files`
- **File Naming**: `${Date.now()}.${fileExt}`
- **Access**: Public URLs for file downloads

## Conclusion

The current ticketing system provides a solid foundation with basic ticket creation and display functionality. However, it lacks critical admin management capabilities and communication features needed for a complete support system.

The system is well-architected with modern technologies and follows good development practices, making it suitable for expansion and enhancement. The main areas requiring attention are:

1. **Admin interface development**
2. **Communication system implementation**
3. **Security and performance optimization**
4. **Advanced feature development**

With the right database information and focused development effort, this system can be transformed into a comprehensive ticketing and support management platform.
