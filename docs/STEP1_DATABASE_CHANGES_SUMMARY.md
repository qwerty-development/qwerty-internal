# Step 1: Database Schema Changes - Summary

## What We're Doing

We're modifying the database schema to support the new client structure with:

- Company Name as the main identifier (instead of Client Name)
- Company Email as the main email
- Contact Person Name and Email fields
- MOF Number field
- Terms and Conditions for quotations

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`docs/CLIENT_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.sql`** - The SQL script you need to run
2. **`docs/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Updated to reflect new schema
3. **`docs/STEP1_DATABASE_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file

## What You Need to Do

1. **Run the SQL Migration Script**:

   - Go to your Supabase SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `docs/CLIENT_SCHEMA_MIGRATION.sql`
   - Execute the script

2. **Verify the Changes**:
   - Check that the `clients` table now has the new structure
   - Check that the `quotations` table has the new fields
   - Verify that existing data is preserved

## What the Migration Does

### For the `clients` table:

- ✅ Renames `name` → `company_name`
- ✅ Renames `contact_email` → `company_email`
- ✅ Adds `contact_person_name` (text)
- ✅ Adds `contact_person_email` (text)
- ✅ Adds `mof_number` (text)
- ✅ Updates unique constraint to use `company_name`

### For the `quotations` table:

- ✅ Adds `terms_and_conditions` (text)
- ✅ Adds new client fields: `company_name`, `company_email`, `contact_person_name`, `contact_person_email`, `mof_number`
- ✅ Keeps existing `client_*` fields for backward compatibility
- ✅ Adds helpful comments to mark deprecated fields

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains backward compatibility by:

- Keeping existing `client_*` fields in quotations table
- Adding comments to mark them as deprecated
- Not removing any existing data

## Next Steps

After you run the SQL script and verify it works, we'll move to:

- **Step 2**: Update client creation/edit forms
- **Step 3**: Update quotation forms
- **Step 4**: Update display components
- **Step 5**: Update portal/client side

## Important Notes

- The migration is designed to be safe and non-destructive
- All existing data will be preserved
- The new fields are optional, so existing records won't break
- We can gradually migrate the application code to use the new fields
